# Google Play Store Deployment Guide for Zoom Tic Tac Toe

This guide will walk you through the complete process of publishing your Zoom Tic Tac Toe game to the Google Play Store using Expo and EAS Build.

## Prerequisites

### 1. Google Play Developer Account
- Visit [Google Play Console](https://play.google.com/console)
- Pay the $25 one-time registration fee
- Complete your developer profile and accept the terms

### 2. Expo Account
- Create a free account at [expo.dev](https://expo.dev)
- You'll use this to build your app

## Step 1: Initial Setup

### Install EAS CLI
```bash
npm install -g eas-cli
```

### Login to Expo
```bash
eas login
```
Enter your Expo account credentials.

### Initialize EAS in your project
```bash
cd react-native-app
eas init
```
This will create a project ID and update your `app.json` file.

## Step 2: Configure Your App

### Update app.json
Make sure your `app.json` has the correct package name (replace "yourdomain" with your actual domain):

```json
{
  "android": {
    "package": "com.corpolatech.zoomtictactoe",
    "versionCode": 1
  }
}
```

**Important:** The package name must be unique across the entire Play Store and cannot be changed later.

### Generate App Icons and Assets

#### Required Assets:
1. **App Icon**: 1024Ã—1024 PNG (no transparency)
2. **Adaptive Icon**: 1024Ã—1024 PNG foreground + background color
3. **Feature Graphic**: 1024Ã—500 PNG for Play Store listing

Place these in your `assets` folder and update `app.json` accordingly.

## Step 3: Build Your App

### Create a Production Build
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile production
```

This will:
- Build an Android App Bundle (.aab file)
- Sign it with a keystore managed by Expo
- Upload it to Expo's servers
- Provide you with a download link

The build process takes 10-20 minutes. You'll receive an email when it's complete.

## Step 4: Test Your Build

### Create a Preview Build (Optional but Recommended)
```bash
eas build --platform android --profile preview
```

This creates an APK file you can install directly on your device for testing.

## Step 5: Prepare Store Assets

### Screenshots Required:
1. **Phone Screenshots**: 2-8 screenshots in PNG or JPG
